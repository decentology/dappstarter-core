# My Dapp

This project is for the blockchain application My Dapp. It contains code for the Smart Contract, web-based dapp and NodeJS server. 

# Pre-requisites

In order to develop and build "My Dapp," the following pre-requisites must be installed:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or any IDE for editing Javascript)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (DappStarter uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces))
///(language:solidity
///)
///(blockchain:flow
* [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cli) (https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cli) (after installation run `flow cadence install-vscode-extension` to enable code highlighting for Cadence source files)
///)
///(blockchain:solana
* [Solana CLI Tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
* Rust (see "Dependency Guides" at the end for help installing) 

### Dependency Checklist 
```bash
$ node --version
$ npm --version
$ rustup --version
$ rustc --version
$ cargo --version
$ solana --version
```

# Installation

Using a terminal (or command prompt), change to the folder containing the project files and type: `yarn` This will fetch all required dependencies. The process will take 1-3 minutes and while it is in progress you can move on to the next step.

# Yarn Errors

You might see failures related to the `node-gyp` package when Yarn installs dependencies.
These failures occur because the node-gyp package requires certain additional build tools
to be installed on your computer. Follow the [instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) for adding build tools and then try running `yarn` again.

# Build, Deploy and Test
///(blockchain:matic

Before you can work with Matic's testnet, you need to request some tokens in your test accounts. To make this request type: `yarn faucet` This will request tokens for all 10 test accounts. You may have to run this command a few times to see the token balances get updated. It isn't necessary to wait until all accounts have tokens – the account labeled (0) is the account used to deploy contracts. Once you see a balance for this account, you can continue.

///)
Using a terminal (or command prompt), change to the folder containing the project files and type: `yarn start` This will run all the dev scripts in each project package.json.

///(blockchain:solana
The first time you run `yarn start` there are a fair number of Rust libraries that are
downloaded and pre-compiled. As a result, it may be take from 5-10 mins. before the
dapp is compiled and launched the first time. On subsequent compilations, the build
time will only be a few seconds.

## Smart Contract

`yarn migrate` to compile contracts/*.sol files, deploy them to the blockchain. 

## Dapp

Run the dapp in a separate terminal. You *must* have run `npm run deploy` for the dapp to see most recent smart contract changes.

`yarn dapp` runs the dapp on http://localhost:5001 using webpack dev server

## Server

Run the server in a separate terminal. You *must* have run `npm run deploy` for the dapp to see most recent smart contract changes.

`yarn server` runs NodeJS server app on port 5002 with NestJS

## Testing

`test-config.js` contains settings used by test scripts

Run tests using `yarn test --script=[test file]`

## Production Builds

DappStarter currently does not provide blockchain migration scripts to be used in production. However, here are the scripts for generating production builds:

`yarn build:prod` generates dapp bundle for production.

## Dependency Guides

This section contains installation guides for common dev environments. 

### Rust

(Source: Solana)
We suggest that you install Rust using the 'rustup' tool. Rustup will install
the latest version of Rust, Cargo, and the other binaries.

Follow the instructions at [Installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

For Mac users, Homebrew is also an option.  The Mac Homebrew command is `brew install rustup` and then
`rustup-init`. See [Mac Setup](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Rust/) &
[Installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for more details.

After installation, you should have `rustc`, `cargo`, & `rustup`. You should
also have `~/.cargo/bin` in your PATH environment variable.
